title: Prandtl Number
---

Prandtl number is the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and thermal diffusivity


$$Pr = \frac{\nu}{\alpha} = \frac{\mu/\rho}{k/(\rho c_p)} = \frac{c_p\mu}{k}$$

Typical values for Prandtl number

air - 0.71
hydrogen - 0.16-0.7
oxygen - 0.63
water - 7.56
engine oil - 100 to 40,000
