The Darcy friction factor was first described by Julius Weisbach, a German professor who in 1850 published the first  modern thextbook on hydrodynamics. It is named after Henry Darcy, a French engieer whose experiments in 1857 first established the effect of roughness on pipe resistance

## 1. Darcy Weisbach equation

$$\frac{\Delta p}{L}=f_D\frac{\rho}{2}\frac{v^2}{D}$$

where,
$f_D$ is the Darcy frirction factor
$\Delta p$ is the pressure drop
$L$ is the length of the pipe
$\rho$ is the density
$v$ is velocity
$D$ is diameter

or interms of pressure head  pressure head is

$$h_f = f_D\frac{L}{D}\frac{v^2}{2g}$$


for Laminar flow $$f_D=\frac{64}{Re}$$

## 2. Fanning Friction factor
Fanning friction factor 

$$f=\frac{\tau}{\rho\frac{v^2}{2}}$$

where,
$f$ is fanning friction factor
$\tau$ is shear stress

Its related to Darcy friction factor by

$$f_D=4f$$
