Moody chart provides the [[friction_factor|friction factor]] for flow through a tube and it is basically just the [[friction_factor_calculations|Colebrook Equation]] plotted up. It is accurate to within +/- 15% for most engineering calculations but somewhat gone out of favor inplace of using direct calculations.
