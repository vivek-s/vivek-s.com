Taylor series expansion of a function *about a point* is an expression of the given function in terms of sum of polynomials with its coefficients given by derivatives of various orders.

A function $f(x)$ can be expressed at a point $x=a$ as
$$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-1)^3+...+\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n+...$$

If $a = 0$ the expansion is called **Maclaurin series**
