title: Emissivity or Emittance
---
Emissivity or Emittance is defined as
$$\epsilon = \frac{Energy\ radiated\ from\ a\ surface}{Energy\ radiated\ by\ a\ black\  body\ at\ same\ temeprature}$$
For Thermal Equilibrium of  a body
$$\epsilon = \alpha$$
[NASA Reference publication 1121]([Solar absorptance and thermal emittance of some common spacecraft thermal-control coatings - NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19840015630)) is a good source for emissivity of common materials

## 1. Factors affecting Emissivity
Emissivity can be a function of wavelength, direction and temperature
### 1.1. Impact of Wavelength
Note that emissivity might vary with wavelength.

Things that look transparent may not be so. For example water is transparent to visible spectrum but it absorbs infra red

### 1.2. Impact of temperature
Emissivity can be a function of temperature

### 1.3. Diffuse vs Specular
Diffuse - reflects radiation in all directions
Specular - changes with source of radiation

## 2. Note on Emissivity vs Emittance
Radiative properties of opaque substances are highly influenced by the surface condition of the samples. Factors such as roughness, surface contaminants, paints, oxide layers etc. highly affect their radiative behavior. Hence, NIST recommends using "-ance" for real world rough and contaminated surfaces and "-ity" for pure, perfectly smooth ideal materials.[^1] This convention does not appear to be strictly followed in various publications and caution should be applied when interpretting the terms.
