Notes from [www.thermalradiation.net/Radiation pioneers with narration 2.mp4](http://www.thermalradiation.net/Radiation%20pioneers%20with%20narration%202.mp4)

- Issac Newton postulated that individual "corpuscles" carried attributes of color. Glass attracted the particles and change their speed causing refraction.
- Christiaan Huygens - postulated possibility of extra-terrestrial lives. Said light was made of waves not "corpuscles". 
- Pierrer Bouger - light had an exponential decay of intensity as it passes through an absorbing medium
- Johan Lambert described exponential decay and cosine dependence of emission from a diffuse surface
- Pierre Prevost - said all bodies emit radiation regardless of surroundings
- William Herschel - discovered Uranus. discovered radiation beyond visible spectrum (infra red)
- Leopoldo Nobili and Macedonio Melloni discvocered that different surface emitted differing characteristics of radiation at same temperature.
- John William Draper - measured intensity of energy vs. temperature. But did not realize T^4 relationship because absolute temperature scale had not been proposed
- Lord Kelvin - proposed absolute temperature scale. Said - "*if you can't measure it and express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind*"
- William Rankine - another absolute temperature scale. studied steam engines
- Gustav Kirchhoff - proposed idea of a blackbody. absorbtivity = emissivity (under certain circumstances)
- James Clerk Maxwell - radiation is made of electromagnetic waves that travel at speed of light
- John Tyndall - experimentalist. Different gases absorb different amount of radiation. Molecular gases (H2O, CO2) absorb more radiation than polar gases (O2,N2)
- Lord Rayleigh - Proposed that light is scattered in proportional to 1/wavelength^4. Hence sky is blue in day and orange in sunset
- Josef Stefan & Ludwig Boltzmann - Stefan Boltzmann law
- William ... Wien - Wiens law distribution of energy among wavelengths. 1911 Nobel prize
- Rayleigh & Jeans proposed an approach that fell apart in lower wavelengths known as *ultraviolet catastrophe*
- Otto Lummer & Ernst Pringsheim - showed Wien's law did not match their experiments
- Max Plank- tweaked Wien's equation to match Lummer and Pringshiem's experiment (stuck a -1 in the denominator of Wien's equation). He said theoretical basis for that is that energy isnt transmitted continuously but sent in "packets", thus forming the basis of modern quantum physics.
- Shuster, Schwarzschild, Rosseland, Milne, Eddington - radiative transfer equation
- 1950s -- computer comes along. no need to mess with RTEs
- Margaret Huggins - showed satars were suns. Showed Sirius is moving away from earth (doppler shift)
Not all were the geniuses we think they were
- Boltzmann - manic depressive and commited suicide because of criticism
- Johannes Stark - was a Nazi sympathizer and convicted war criminal
- Kelvin - Radio has no future; Xrays are a hoax; airplanes are impossible
