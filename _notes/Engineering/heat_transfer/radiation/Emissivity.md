Emissivity is defined as
$$\epsilon = \frac{Energy\ radiated\ by\ a\ material's\ surface}{Energy\ radiated\ by\ a\ black\  body\ at\ same\ conditions}$$
For Thermal Equilibrium of  a body
$$\epsilon = \alpha$$
[NASA Reference publication 1121]([Solar absorptance and thermal emittance of some common spacecraft thermal-control coatings - NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19840015630)) is a good source for emissivity of common materials

### 0.1. Impact of Wavelength
Note that emissivity might vary with wavelength.

Things that look transparent may not be so. For example water is transparent to visible spectrum but it absorbs infra red

### 0.2. Impact of temperature
Emissivity can be a function of temperature

### 0.3. Diffuse vs Specular
Diffuse - reflects radiation in all directions
Specular - changes with source of radiation

Opaque Gray diffuse radiation is what is solved in ANSYS. Radiation is a boundary condition
