title: Absorptance or Absorptivity
---

Absorbtance is not purely a surface property like [[Emittance]]. 

## 1. 2.Solar Absorbtance and  Absorptance-Emittance ($\alpha_s/\epsilon_{ir}$ or a/e) ratio
Absorbtance of real materials might have a strong spectral dependency (i.e dependency on the wavelength). For example a substance might have very low emittance/absorbtance in the visible and near infrared spectrum but might have a high emittance/absorbtance in the far infrared spectrum. Such a material would be very good at reflecting most of solar radiation and also be great at emitting whatevery radiant energy it absorbs at a higher wavelength as far infrared radiation.

Such material with low a/e ratio (absorptance/emittance) ratio are great for keeping a surface cool under solar loading. Some types of white paint fall in this category. On the other hand a surfaces with high a/e ratio absorb solar radiation better than they are able to emit them.


Standard test method for solar absorptance is [ASTM E 903](https://www.astm.org/e0903-20.html)
