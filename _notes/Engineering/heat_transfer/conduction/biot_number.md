title: Biot Number

## 1. Biot Number

Biot number is a dimensionless parameter that represents the ratio of convection to conduction from solid interior

$$Bi=\frac{hL}{k}$$
where,
$h$ - heat transfer coefficient,
$L$ - characteristic length,
$k$ - thermal conductivity

## 2. Interpretation of Biot Number
- If Biot number is small eg. $Bi <1$ conduction is faster than convection and the temperature distribution is uniform. 
- If Biot number is very small (<0.1), temperature distribution within the body can ge ignored and the body can be considered as  a lumped mass.
- When Biot number is large $Bi > 1$ conduction is slower than convection and temperature gradient of the solid interior needs to be taken into account
