title: Temperature Measurement

## 1. Thermocouples
A thermo couple consists of a pair of junctions of two dissimilar metals that creates an electric potential (voltage) proportional to the temperature difference between the junctions. If one junction is maintained at a known temperature (reference temperature), the voltage measured reflects the temperature of the other junction. 

Different metal combinations are used for different temperature ranges. The size of the junction must be kept small to have a short repsonse time.
