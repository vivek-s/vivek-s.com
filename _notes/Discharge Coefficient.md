## Incompressible flow
Discharge coefficient of  a nozzle or a valve is the ratio of actual discharge to ideal discharge.
>[!Summary]
$$Q = C_dA_t\left[\frac{2(p_1-p_2)\rho}{1-\beta^4}\right]^{1/2}$$
where,
$\beta$ - diameter ratio (throat dia/inlet dia)
$A_t$ - Throat area


The $(1-\beta^4)^{-1/2}$ term is also known as *velocity-of-approach* factor
### Flow Coefficient
The following term is known as flow coefficient
$$\alpha = \frac{C_d}{(1-\beta^4)^{1/2}}$$
Expressed in terms of flow coefficient the mass flow rate is
$$\dot{m}=\alpha A_t \sqrt{2\rho\Delta P}$$
